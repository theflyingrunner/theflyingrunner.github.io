                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p> This project started back in March 2021, when I first learned about the Brayton cycle in my thermodynamics class. 
                    Gas turbine engines are fascinating pieces of technology which are prevalent in power generation plants and modern airliners.
                    This design is based on the KJ66 engine, which was developed back in the late '90s. 
                    I have modernized the design to improve performance, efficiency, and reliability.
                    The primary goal is to design, build, and test a micro-turbojet engine capable of producing 80-100 N of thrust.</p>

                <h3>I. Preliminary Design and Analysis</h3>
                <p> 
                    The first step was to establish a preliminary analysis based on design parameters. 
                    The specifications of the KJ66 were used as a reference along with parameters from Benini et al.
                    A MATLAB script was created using the procedure highlighted in Hill & Peterson.
                    The results of the preliminary analysis are listed in <b>Table 1</b> below along with 
                    design parameters of similar engines.

                <h3>II. Component Design, CAD, and Fabrication</h3>
                <p>
                    After preliminary design, the process of modelling the engine began.
                    The sectional view presented of the entire system is presented <b>(Fig. 1)</b> below.
                    The major components that can be seen include the compressor, consisting of the
                    impeller, diffuser, and inlet; the combustor, consisting of the comustion chamber and 
                    fuel distribution system; the turbine, consisting of the axial rotor and stator
                    nozzle guide vanes; the shaft, shaft housing, and bearing subsystem; and the housing.

                    <div class="single-image">

                </div>
                <h4>A. Compressor</h4>
                <p>
                    The rotor needs to produce a pressure ratio of 2.2 at a rotor speed of 120,000 RPM. 
                    A 1-stage centrifugal compressor with a dual diffusion setup is appropriate for an engine of this size and required performance parameters. 
                    When I first began planning this project in 2021, 
                    I decided to use turbocharger impeller as it is a cheap and easily obtained solution. 
                    The diffuser uses a set of radial vanes to reduce flow velocity and increase static pressure 
                    as well as a set of axial vanes to straighten flow into the combustor.

                <p>
                    The rotor <b>(Fig. 2)</b> is the K26 flatback compressor wheel, model 5326-123-2038. 
					It is made out of aluminum with an outer wheel diameter of 66 mm, 
					inducer diameter of 46.15 mm. The rotor has 6 main blades and 6 splitter blades.
					It meets our performance requirement of pressure ratio of ~2 at ~100,000 RPM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The radial vanes on the diffuser <b>(Fig. 3)</b> were selected to be the reliable wedge-shaped design, 
                    commonly found in impeller-diffuser systems.
					Velocity triangles were drawn to determine appropriate vane angles.
					15 radial vanes were modeled to avoid potential resonance effects in conjunction with the rotor blades.
					The radial vane design also allows for holes to be drilled into the wedges to allow for mounting screws and fitting tubes.

                    The axial vanes straighten the flow and further decelerate it before it enters 
                    the combustor. For protyping and early testing, the diffuser was SLA 3-D printed from
                    high temperature resin <b>(Fig. 3)</b>. 
                    Currently, I am working on fabricating the diffuser from aluminum for
                    the final product.
                </p>
                <h4>B. Combustor</h4>
                <p>
                    The combustor is modeled from the KJ66 combustor with a few developments.
                    The primary fuel source is liquid kerosene. The original KJ66 version utilized
                    gas-start with propane or butane with a glow plug for starting the flame. 
                    In this design, I intend to use a kero-start system similar to that of the Jetcat engines.
                    This will eliminate the need for gas feed lines.

                    The combustor <b>(Fig. 4)</b> was laser cut from stainless steel 316 sheet metal.
                    It's constructed from four distinct pieces—external combustor wall, internal
                    combustor wall, front wall, and rear wall. 
                    It was then rolled using a sheet metal roller to form the curved combustor walls.
                    I initially used a TIG welder to join the walls, but found a spot welder to be
                    a better option.
                    <br />

                    The fuel distributor <b>(Fig. 4d)</b> was constructed from brass tubing, 
                    which was rolled and silver soldered.
                    For the injectors, I used stainless steel 316 hypodermic tubes.
                    These were silver soldered to the brass fuel distributor ring.
                    Currently, I am working on implementing the kero-start system to the combustor.

                <h4>C. Turbine</h4>
                <p>
                    Whilst the compressor is centrifugal type, the turbine is an axial type with 
                    an axial rotor and nozzle guide vanes (NGV) <b>(Fig. 5)</b>. Velocity triangles were drawn to select
                    rotor and guide vane angles.
                    The rotor was fabricated using lost-wax casting from Inconel-718c. 
                    This nickel-based supperalloy is used commonly in commercial jet engines as well
                    for its strength at high temperatures and large rotor speeds. 
                    The NGV was fabricated using lost-wax casting from stainless steel 316. 
                    It is rated for temperatures up to 1273 K, which was used to determine the maximum 
                    turbine inlet temperature for the engine.
                    Due to the difficulty and specialized process of lost-wax casting, 
                    both the rotor and NGV were manufactured by the Swiss vendor Jetmax.

                    The shaft and shaft housing prototypes were 3-D printed from polycarbonate.
                    In the final product will use a shaft fabricated from steel 4340 using a CNC lathe.
                    The shaft housing will be constructed from aluminum using a CNC lathe.
                    Though both the compressor and tubrine rotors are already balanced,
                    once the metal shaft is constructed, the rotor-shaft assembly will need to
                    be re-balanced.

              The current assembled prototype of the BD66 is presented below <b>(Fig. 6)</b>. 
              The components that are ready for the final product include the compressor impeller,
              turbine rotor, turbine nozzle guide vanes, and combustion chamber.
              The other components were 3-D printed to test for fit and functionality.
              After a few minor design changes, the components will be fabricated from metal.
              The fuel distribution system will be remade to better fit the engine housing.
              The engine will then undergo a rigorous testing phase.

              This project is made possible thanks to a number of amazing and talented people.
              They include:
              The Gas Turbine Builders Association for the wealth of information on micro-scale gas turbine engines;
              The Bechtel Innovation Design Center at Purdue and the wonderful TAs;
              Prof. Li Qiao, the super team of AAE 535, and our mentors from Rolls-Royce and Kratos.
              Dieter Albissir of Jetmax for the intricate lost-wax casting work.
