                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p> This project started back in March 2021, when I first learned about the Brayton cycle in my thermodynamics class. 
                    Gas turbine engines are fascinating pieces of technology which are prevalent in power generation plants and modern airliners.
                    This design is based on the KJ66 engine, which was developed back in the late '90s. 
                    I have modernized the design to improve performance, efficiency, and reliability.
                    The primary goal is to design, build, and test a micro-turbojet engine capable of producing 80-100 N of thrust.</p>
