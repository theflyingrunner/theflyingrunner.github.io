                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This project aims to solve the famous Sod Shock Tube problem using the Steger-Warming scheme. 
                    Two approaches are used, one where the solution at the cell faces are computed using 
                    a first-order extrapolation and another using the MUSCL formalism.

                    A shock tube is a long pipe, which is divided into a driver section and a driven section by a diaphragm [2].
                    The driver section is pressurized with an inert gas, and the driven section contains the test gas mixture that is under experimental investigation. 
                    Following the rupture of the diaphragm, a normal shock develops which propagates into the driven section and is reflected at the end wall.
                    The Sod shock tube problem is a commonly used validation case for fluid dymanics models. 
                    The initial conditions for the Sod shock tube problem are such that the driver side is

                    and the driven side is 
                    $\lbrack

                    The Steger-Warming scheme is an upwind method for solving compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in high-speed flows [1].
                    It is a  flux vector splitting (FVS) method that splits the fluxes into positive and negative parts in accordance with the 
                    propagation of the information. 
                    However, some inaccuracies are present in this scheme due to the effect of a fictitious pressue gradient that is developed in the boundary layer,
                    thereby lending to the scheme's first-order accuracy.
                    One remedy is to use the Monotonic Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) formalism in conjunction with the Steger-Warming scheme.
                    This improves the model to third-order accuracy.

                <p>
                    The solver code was written in C and the results were analyzed in MATLAB.
                    The code repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/theflyingrunner/sod-shock-tube">here</a>, along with the instructions

                <p>
                    The results validate the model developed for this test case. 
                    Figure 2 showcases the difference in accuracy between the Steger-Warming scheme using MUSCL and without MUSCL.
                    The effects of the fictitious pressure gradient in the boundary layer can be seen clearly.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This project shows the development of numerical finite difference techniques and their subsequent validation using popular test cases.
                For any aspiring fluid dynamicists, it is imperative to understand the underlying numerical schemes used in commercial CFD packages.
                My hope is that this project inspires and guides those who are interested in honing their CFD skills.
