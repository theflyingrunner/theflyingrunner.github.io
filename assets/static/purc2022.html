                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p> I was first introduced to ROS during my time in Vertically Integrated Projects at Purdue under Prof. James Goppert.
					I honed in on these skills and learned more abour integrating Deep Learning networks with ROS during my
					time at the Digital Agriculture Discovery Lab as part of the SUR Fellowship at Purdue.
					This project aims to integrate various Deep Learning technologies such as detection networks and large language models
					with Robot Operating System to construct a multipurpose rover. I am currently working on implementing GPT-3 using the chatGPT API
					as well as Google's speech APIs to enable a user to speak to the rover through chatAPI.
					Additionally, I will be implementing SLAM and navigation using ROS2 to allow for autonomous navigation.
					Finally, I will integrate all these so that a user can verbally operate the rover to begin SLAM, detection, navigation,
					and other operations.
