<h1>BD66 micro-turbojet engine</h1> 
<hr />
<h2>description & objectives:</h2>
<p>This project started back in March 2021, when I first learned about the Brayton cycle in my thermodynamics class. 
	Gas turbine engines are fascinating pieces of technology which are prevalent in power generation plants and modern airliners.
	This design is based on the KJ66 engine, which was developed back in the late '90s. 
	I have modernized the design to improve performance, efficiency, and reliability.
	The primary goal is to design, build, and test a micro-turbojet engine capable of producing 80-100 N of thrust.

<h2>design process:</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Preliminary design and analysis: The first step was to establish a preliminary analysis based on design parameters. 
			The specifications of the KJ66 were used as a reference along with parameters from Benini et al.
			A MATLAB script was created using the procedure highlighted in Hill & Peterson.
			The compressor pressure ratio is 2.2 at a maximum of 120,000 RPM.
			A maximum turbine inlet temperature of 1170 K was selected with kerosene as primary fuel source.
			This results in an estimated specific thrust of 438.77 N-s/kg and TSFC of 3.3014E-07 kg/kN-s.
			At an estimated mass flow rate of 0.22 kg/s at max RPM, the thrust is 97 N.
			This is an improvement over the thrust of 75 N produced by the KJ66.</li>

		<li>Design in CAD: After preliminary design, the process of modelling the engine began.
