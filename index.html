<h2>about me:</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page! Here you will learn a little bit about my life and my work. 
	I graduated from Purdue University with a BS in aerospace engineering and biology. 
	Learning and creating have a special place in my heart. 
	When I'm not working on engineering projects, I create and produce music. 
	I also have a cat named Toothless (who also happens to be toothless)—you can find pictures of her <a href="./assets/static/toothless.html">here</a>.</p>
